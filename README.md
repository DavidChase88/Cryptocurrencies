# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview

The purpose of the project is to present data to a prominent investment bank interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The final data includes what cryptocurrencies are still on the trading market and how they can be grouped to create a new classification system for possible investments. I performed unsupervised machine learning to conduct the analysis.

## Results

First I cleaned the data so that it only included cryptocurrencies that was still trading, have a defined algorithm and have no missing data points. After applying these filters I had 532 different cryptocurrencies. Then I looked at a k-means algorithm to determine the ideal number of groups.
